Program goal: To make a deminer with an interactive window. Here it is an alternative to the basic program.

Language: R with Python package.

This folder contains two files that are an alternative to the non-functioning Shiny application. This alternative is proposed in R and Python. 
When launching R with the .R file, named demin.R, the .py file is called and executed, named demin.py.


WARNING: when launching the .R file in RStudio check and modify the path of the .py file. The location will depend on where you have placed the .py file.
